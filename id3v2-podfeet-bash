# This script will add a set of ID3 tags and album artwork to your podcast file. I have tested it with audio but not video files.  It uses the spec from id3.org and the library id3v2 from Myer's Carpenter at https://github.com/myers/id3v2 (available via homebrew).
# The script will entitle your podcast episode with the name of the input file without extension.  

#=== Please edit the following variables ===#

# Path to album artwork file name with extension
